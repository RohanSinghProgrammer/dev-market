# Next.js Application Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run a Next.js application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later) installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm or yarn package manager (npm comes bundled with Node.js)
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and React

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**

   Start the Next.js development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or with yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. **Build the application for production**

   To create an optimized production build, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   Or with yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

5. **Start the production server**

   After building, start the production server with:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or with yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

6. **Additional scripts**

   - **Linting**

     To run ESLint and check for linting errors:

     ```bash
     npm run lint
     ```

     Or with yarn:

     ```bash
     yarn lint
     ```

## Project Structure

- `app/` - Contains the main application code and pages.
- `components/` - Reusable React components.
- `models/` - Database models and schemas.
- `public/` - Static assets like images and fonts.
- `styles/` - CSS and styling files.

## Notes

- Make sure your environment variables (if any) are set up correctly.
- For more information, visit the official Next.js documentation: [https://nextjs.org/docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues during setup, try deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling dependencies.
- Ensure your Node.js version is compatible with the Next.js version used.
